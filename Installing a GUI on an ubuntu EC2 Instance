sudo apt-get install tasksel
What is tasksel:-
Tasksel is a Debian/Ubuntu tool that installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated "task" onto your system.

This function is similar to that of meta-packages, and, in fact, most of the 
tasks available from tasksel are also available as meta-packages from the Ubuntu package managers (
such as Synaptic Package Manager or KPackageKit). 

sudo apt-get install slim
sudo apt-get install lightdm
tasksel

# A colorful interface will launch. Use the arrow key to scroll down the list and find Ubuntu desktop. 
Use the Space key to select it, press Tab to select OK at the bottom, then press Enter. The system will install the software and reboot, giving you a graphical login screen generated by your default display manager. In our case, itâ€™s SLiM.
Enter your login credentials. Use F1 to switch between GUIs if you have multiple interfaces installed.
